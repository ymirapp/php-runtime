# Ymir PHP Runtime

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/ymirapp/php-runtime/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ymirapp/php-runtime/actions)

[Ymir][1] PHP runtime for [AWS Lambda][2].

## Acknowledgements

This PHP runtime wouldn't exist without the tireless work of [Matthieu Napoli][3] and the rest of the [bref][4] contributors. 
Most of the code to compile PHP started from their implementation. The initial inspiration for the PHP code comes from an 
[interview][5] between [Adam Wathan][6] and [Taylor Otwell][7] about [Laravel Valet][8].

[![Built with Depot](https://depot.dev/badges/built-with-depot.svg)](https://depot.dev/?utm_source=Ymir)

## How to use the runtime

The runtime layers are publicly available. You can just add one to your Lambda function. You'll find all the current layer ARN in the `layers.json` or `layers.php` files. 

## Contributing

Install dependencies using composer:

```console
$ composer install
```

Run tests using phpunit:
